        Iterate over the key-value pairs of keys matching a glob pattern.

        The `pattern` is used to match keys, and it may contain the following
        specifiers:

        - ``*`` matches any number of characters, *except for slashes*.
        - ``**`` matches any number of characters, *including slashes*.

        It is possible to escape asterisk characters, using ``\*``, in
        which case the asterisk loses its meaning as a specifier and it will
        be matched literally. Also, note that to match a literal backslash
        character, you need to use ``\\\\`` (double backslash).

        The main use-case for pattern specifiers is enumerating and retrieving
        sets of values which share a common key prefix. This is a common
        pattern: related values are all stored using keys with a common
        prefix, for example where each user of a system has ``/user/`` at
        the beginning of its key, plus an unique identifier, then one can
        enumerate all the users with a the query pattern ``/user/*``  (or
        ``/user/**`` if there are multiple slash-separated *levels* in the
        keys).

        :param pattern:
            Query pattern.
        :param limit:
            Maximum number of elements returned by the query. Using `None`
            returns *all* the matched elements.
        :param offset:
            Index of the first element to return.
        :return:
            Iterable which yields *(key, value)* pairs.
